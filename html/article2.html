<h1>What Is Happiness?</h1>
<img src="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2019/09/29/opinion/sunday/29HolsonStill/29HolsonStill-superJumbo.jpg" width="850" height="550" alt="an image about happiness">
<p>Happiness is an emotional state characterized by feelings of joy, satisfaction, contentment, and fulfillment. While happiness has many different definitions, it is often described as involving positive emotions and life satisfaction. 
When most people talk about happiness, they might be talking about how they feel in the present moment, or they might be referring to a more general sense of how they feel about life overall.
Because happiness tends to be such a broadly defined term, psychologists and other social scientists typically use the term 'subjective well-being' when they talk about this emotional state. Just as it sounds, subjective well-being tends to focus on an individual's overall personal feelings about their life in the present.</p>
<p>Two key components of happiness (or subjective well-being) are:</p>
<ul>
    <li>
        <b>The balance of emotions:</b> Everyone experiences both positive and negative emotions, feelings, and moods. Happiness is generally linked to experiencing more positive feelings than negative.
    </li>
    <li>
        <b>Life satisfaction:</b> This relates to how satisfied you feel with different areas of your life including your relationships, work, achievements, and other things that you consider important.
    </li>
</ul>
<h2>How To Know If You're Happy</h2>
<p>While perceptions of happiness may be different from one person to the next, there are some key signs that psychologists look for when measuring and assessing happiness.</p>
<P>Some key signs of happiness include:</P>
<ul>
    <li>
        Feeling like you are living the life you wanted
    </li>
    <li>
        Feeling that the conditions of your life are good
    </li>
    <li>
        Feeing that you have accomplished (or will accomplish) what you want in life
    </li>
    <li>
        Feeling satisfied with your life
    </li>
    <li>
        Feeling positive more than negative
    </li>
</ul>
<h2>Types Of Happiness</h2>
<p>There are many different ways of thinking about happiness. For example, the ancient Greek philosopher Aristotle made a distinction between two different kinds of happiness: hedonia and eudaimonia.</p>
<ul>
    <li>
        <b>Hedonia:</b> Hedonic happiness is derived from pleasure. It is most often associated with doing what feels good, self-care, fulfilling desires, experiencing enjoyment, and feeling a sense of satisfaction.
    </li>
    <li>
        <b>Eudaimonia:</b>This type of happiness is derived from seeking virtue and meaning. Important components of eudaimonic well-being including feeling that your life has meaning, value, and purpose. It is associated more with fulfilling responsibilities, investing in long-term goals, concern for the welfare of other people, and living up to personal ideals.
    </li>
</ul>
<p>Hedonia and eudemonia are more commonly known today in psychology as pleasure and meaning, respectively. More recently, psychologists have suggested the addition of the third component that relates to engagement. These are feelings of commitment and participation in different areas of life.</p>
<p>Research suggests that happy people tend to rank pretty high on eudaimonic life satisfaction and better than average on their hedonic life satisfaction.</p>
